            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Succulent pan-seared salmon fillets, perfectly cooked to a flaky tenderness, are the star of this elegant yet easy-to-prepare dish. Complemented by a bright lemon-dill sauce and served alongside roasted asparagus, it's a healthy and flavorful meal that's impressive enough for guests but simple enough for any night of the week.</p>

            <h2>Salmon Dish (Pan-Seared with Lemon-Dill)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare Salmon: Pat salmon fillets dry, season with salt, pepper, and a touch of garlic powder.</li>
                <li>Sear Salmon: Heat olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Place salmon skin-side down (if applicable) and sear for 4-6 minutes per side, or until cooked through and flaky. Remove from pan.</li>
                <li>Make Sauce: In the same pan, add butter or a bit more olive oil. Deglaze with a splash of white wine or broth, then stir in fresh lemon juice and chopped fresh dill.</li>
                <li>Reduce Sauce: Simmer the sauce for a couple of minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
                <li>Serve: Drizzle the lemon-dill sauce over the cooked salmon. Serve immediately, perhaps with roasted vegetables.</li>
